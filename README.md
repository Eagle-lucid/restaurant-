# Lucid Cuisine - Homepage

## Overview
The homepage for *Lucid Cuisine* is designed to introduce visitors to the restaurant and its offerings, showcasing the brand's dedication to authentic African cuisine. The homepage provides a smooth navigation experience that guides users through the different sections of the page.

## Key Features

1. **Navigation Bar**:
   The navigation bar is placed at the top of the page and includes buttons that scroll to different sections of the homepage. The buttons available are:
   - **Home**: Scrolls to the top of the homepage.
   - **Service**: Scrolls to the section detailing the services provided by *Lucid Cuisine*.
   - **Menu**: Placeholder button for future content related to the restaurant's menu.
   - **Contact**: Scrolls to the contact section in the footer.

2. **Scrolling Feature**:
   To enhance user experience, a JavaScript function (`scrollToSection()`) is used to scroll smoothly to different sections of the homepage when navigation buttons are clicked. The scroll animation works by targeting the `id` of each section and smoothly scrolling to it.
   
   **Note**: The scrolling experience is not as seamless as it could be due to the current lack of content on the page. As more content is added, the scrolling will feel more natural, especially when sections have more height.

3. **Content Sections**:
   - **Chef & Restaurant Info**: Introduces the head chef and highlights the restaurant's vision and dedication to serving authentic African cuisine.
   - **Services**: Lists the various services provided by *Lucid Cuisine*, including dine-in experiences, catering, cooking classes, and more. This section was dynamically generated using JavaScript, allowing for easy updates in the future.
   - **Footer**: Contains contact information and social media links for the restaurant.

4. **Dynamic Content**:
   The content for the chef and services section is dynamically injected into the page via JavaScript. This makes it easier to manage and update content in the future without needing to modify the HTML file directly.

5. **Responsiveness**:
   The homepage design is not fully responsive and adjusts to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across devices. However, because the content is currently minimal, the layout may not fully reflect its potential on smaller screens until more sections are added.

## Achievements

- Successfully implemented smooth scrolling navigation across different sections of the page.
- Created a dynamic content generation system for the services section.
- Designed a responsive layout for the homepage to ensure compatibility with various devices.

## Future Improvements

- **Content Expansion**: As more content is added, the scrolling behavior will improve, and the homepage will feel more dynamic and engaging.
- **Enhanced Visual Design**: Once more sections and visual elements are in place, further optimization can be done to enhance the user experience.
